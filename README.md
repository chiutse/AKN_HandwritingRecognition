# AKeNe Handwriting recognition plugin

## Brief Description

This project is a plugin made in Unity 3D that create, manage and recognise a gesture done by the mouse.

## Full Description

This Project is part from AKeNe library created by [Cédric Plessiet](mailto:cedric.plessiet@univ-paris8.fr) in INREV Laboratory in Paris 8 University. The library is designed to contains major solutions that researchers use to devleop virtual reality applications. It simplify the creation of many complex data structures and the use of algorithmes related to them.

My contribution to AKeNe library was to implement HMM(Hidden Markov Model) data structure and the way to create it and use it. And as an exemple of use, I created a plugin in Unity 3D that use HMM to present a 2D gesture, to learn it and to recognise it when it is drawn.

## How to use the plugin

* Please Install Unity 3D and run it
* In the main menu, go to AkeNe -> 1.AI -> Mouse Gesture Recogniser
* A new game object named "MouseGesturesRecogniser" will be added
* Select it and go to the Inspector window. You can add, remove or evaluate a gesture drawn by the mouse.
